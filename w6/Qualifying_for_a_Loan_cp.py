"""**The Problem: Qualifying for a loan**
1.Does the person have a job, and if so, how long have they worked there, and how much money do they make?
2.Is there good collateral for the loan? (for example, is the loan against a car or home that is worth at least the amount of the loan?)
3.Does the person have a good credit score or history of paying back loans?
4.How much other debt does the person have?
5.How much money does the person have?
6.Will the person have a down payment, and if so, what percentage of the loan does it amount to?

"""Determine how fast an object will fall.

is function that computes the speed after "t" seconds have elapsed

C = drag constant (0.5 for sphere, 1.1 for cylinder falling on itâ€™s side. You could look it up for other shapes.)
exp = the number e (2.71828) to the given exponent. This can be computed in Python with the Math library function math.exp(value).
sqrt = the square root of the given expression. This can be computed in Python with the Math library function math.sqrt(value)."""

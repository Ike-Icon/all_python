"""Many vehicle owners record the fuel efficiency of their vehicles as a way to 
track the health of the vehicle. If the fuel efficiency of a vehicle suddenly drops, 
there is probably something wrong with the engine or drive train of the vehicle. 
In the United States, fuel efficiency for gasoline powered vehicles is calculated 
as miles per gallon. In most other countries, fuel efficiency is calculated as liters per 100 kilometers.

The formula for computing fuel efficiency in miles per gallon is the following:

       end âˆ’ start
 mpg = ------------
       gallons

where start and end are both odometer values in miles and gallons is a fuel amount in U.S. gallons.
The formula for converting miles per gallon to liters per 100 kilometers is the following:

         235.215
lp100k = ---------
         mpg
